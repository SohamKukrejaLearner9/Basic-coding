<p> Hi — I’m Soham Kukreja, a beginner BTech student in IIoT. I’ve worked with basic Python (loops, lists, inputs) and HTML. I’m excited to learn practical projects — especially Frontend web and IoT system design. I’d love to help with diagramming or small web pages while I upskill. I’m here to learn and contribute.
